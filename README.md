# Hello World 3DS

This is a simple "Hello World" application for the Nintendo 3DS, written in C++23.

## Features

-   Uses **CMake** for building instead of the **Makefile** used in [3ds-examples](https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds-examples/).
-   Compatible with **Visual Studio Code** extensions **clangd** and **CMake Tools**.
-   Preconfigured with a `3DS` [CMake kit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/blob/767662f0302aede88329d008794739840221251b/docs/kits.md#project-kits).

It assumes [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) is installed at `/opt/devkitpro` (customize the `toolchainFile` path in the kit if needed).
